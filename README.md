# Family-Visited-Countries
A project in which it is possible to have more users who can mark the countries they have visited.

In this project I use express.js and pg to consume and write data to my database. In this example, I use 3 tables: users, visited_countries, and countries.
I filled in countries table with csv file that I commited.
